  </strong>The following describes the actions you may take with respect to the  protected health information that we maintain.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <strong>14.1&nbsp;Inspect and Copy Records.<br />
</strong>You may request to inspect and obtain a copy of any of your protected  health information that may be used to make decisions about you and your  treatment for as long as we maintain this information in our records.

Under federal law, however, you may not  inspect or copy the following: (1) information compiled in reasonable anticipation  or, or use in, legal proceedings; or (2) protected health information that is  subject to a law that prohibits access to protected health information.</p>
      <p>To inspect or obtain a  copy of your protected health information, please complete and submit our Request  for Access to Protected Health Information form to the Patient Services  Department. For a copy of the Request for Access to Protected Health  Information form, please call us at<strong><u> 1-650-690-9100 or toll free at 1-888-947-8957.</u></strong> If you request a copy of  your protected health information, we may charge a fee for the costs of  copying, mailing, or other supplies we use to fulfill your request.<br />
        We ordinarily will  respond to your request within 30 days if the protected health information is  located at our Northridge headquarters and within 60 days if it is located at  another facility. If we need additional time to respond, we will notify you in  writing within the foregoing time frame to explain the reason for the delay and  when you can expect to have a final answer to your request. <br />
        Under certain  circumstances, we may deny your request to inspect or obtain a copy of your  protected health information. If we deny part or your entire request, we will  provide a written denial that explains our reasons for doing so, and a complete  description of how you can have that decision reviewed and how to file a  complaint about these issues with us or with the Secretary of the Department of  Health and Human Services. If we deny only part of your request, we will  provide complete access to the remaining parts.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>14.2 Amend Records.<br />
  </strong>If you believe that the protected health information we have about you is  incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to amend the protected health  information. You can request an amendment so long as the protected health  information is kept in our records. To request an amendment, please submit a  written request to our Privacy Official at the address above. Your request must  include your reason for the request.<br />
        Ordinarily we will  respond to your request within 60 days. If we need additional time to respond,  we will notify you in writing within such 60-day period to explain the reason  for the delay and when you can expect a response to your request.<br />
  <br />
        If we deny part or your entire amendment request, we will send you a written  notice that explains our reasons for doing so. If you disagree with our  decision, you may submit a statement explaining the basis for your  disagreement, which we will include in your records. We may prepare and provide  you with a copy of a rebuttal to your statement of disagreement. We will also  provide information on how to file a complaint with us or with the Secretary of  the Department of Health and Human Services. These procedures will be explained  in more detail in any written denial notice we send you.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>14.3 An Accounting of Disclosures.<br />
</strong>You can request an &quot;accounting of disclosures&quot; which provides  information about how we have shared your protected health information with  other persons or organizations. However, you may only receive an accounting of  disclosures made after April 13, 2003 and made within the six (6) years prior  to the date of your request. In addition, an accounting will not include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disclosures we made to you;</li>
        <li>Disclosures you authorized;</li>
        <li>Disclosures we made in order to provide you  with treatment, obtain payment for that treatment, or conduct our normal  business operations;</li>

        <li>To request an accounting, please write to our  Privacy Official at the address above. Your request must state a time period  for the disclosures you want us to include.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may receive one  accounting in any 12-month period without charge, but we may charge you for the  cost of providing any additional accounting within the same 12-month period. We  will always notify you of any cost involved so that you may choose to withdraw  or modify your request before any costs are incurred.<br />
        <br />
        Ordinarily we will respond to your request for an accounting within 60 days. If  we need additional time to prepare the accounting, we will notify you in  writing within the 60-day period to explain the reason for the delay and when  you can expect to receive the accounting. In rare cases, we may need to delay  providing you with the accounting without notifying you at the request of a law  enforcement official or government agency.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>15. MORE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS.<br />
  </strong>You may request that we communicate with you about your protected health  information in an alternate manner or means. For example, you may ask that we  contact you at home instead of work. To request an alternate means of  communication or an alternate manner of communication, please write to our  Privacy Official at the address above. We will not ask you the reason for your  request, and we will try to accommodate all reasonable requests. Please specify  in your request how or where you wish to be contacted, and how payment for your  health care will be handled if we communicate with you in this alternate manner  or means.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>16. STRICTER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS.<br />
</strong>You may request that we adopt stricter privacy protections than the privacy  protections set forth in this Notice with respect to uses or disclosures of  your protected health information for (1) Treatment, Payment and Health Care  Operations, and/or (2) to your Family and Friends, as described above. Please  submit your request in writing to our Privacy Official at the address above  specifying the PHI and the restriction(s) being requested.
