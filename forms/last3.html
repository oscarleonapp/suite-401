<p>Laboratory Consent
</p>
<p>As part of your medical care, we may order certain laboratory testing.  Specimens collected in our office may be sent to an outside laboratory for analysis and will be billed by the lab separately from your office visit.  We will attempt to see that the laboratory has your correct insurance information.  By signing this consent you are giving us permission to send your lab work out when necessary and you agree to be financially responsible for any charges not covered under your insurance contract.

<p>No-Show, Late-Cancellation and Late-Reschedule Policy
</p>
<p>To cancel or reschedule an appointment, please let us know 48 hours in advance.</p>
<p>&quot;No Show&quot; is someone who misses an appointment without canceling or rescheduling it 48 hours in advance. $45.00 no show fee will apply.</p>
<p>&quot;Late cancellations&quot; or &quot;late reschedules&quot;:
  If you should fail to provide notice of cancellation for an appointment 48 hours in advance, you will be assessed a charge of $45.00 for each missed appointment, due at the time of your next visit.
</p>
<p>By signing the &quot;no-show/late cancellation policy,&quot; I agree that this charge will be my responsibility to pay and that I understand that the no-show/late cancellation charge is not covered by health plans and is not part of my co-pay charge.

<h2>Upfront Payment</h2>
<p>All patient responsibilities, including co-pays and deductibles will be collected at the time services are rendered.  Please make sure to have cash or credit card with you.  The exact collectible fees are determined after the visit with the Doctor, however an approximate out of pocket cost can be pre-calculated based on your insurance contract fee schedules.  Please feel free to discuss any concerns or questions you may have with anyone of our billing staff.  We will assist you in your understanding the complexities of health insurance policies and covered services.</p>
