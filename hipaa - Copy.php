  <h2 ><strong><u>Notice of Privacy  Practices â€“ for protected health information</u></strong></h2>
  <p >&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>1.&nbsp;BACKGROUND</strong><br />
    This Notice of Privacy Practices (the &quot;Notice&quot;) describes how we may  use and disclose your protected health information. This Notice also describes  how you can access and control your protected health information.  &quot;Protected health information&quot; is information that may identify you  and that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health or  condition, related health care services or your past, present or future payment  for health care. <br />
    We are required by law  to protect the privacy of protected health information, and to provide you with  a copy of this Notice, which describes our legal duties and privacy practices  with respect to protected health information. Please note, we may change any of  the privacy practices set forth in our Notice at any time (a &quot;New  Notice&quot;). We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice until a New  Notice becomes effective. The New Notice will be effective for all protected  health information that we maintain as of the effective date of such New Notice,  even if we collected or received the protected health information prior to the  New Notice's effective date. A copy of our current Notice is posted at our  Websites. You may request a paper copy at any time, even if you have previously  agreed to receive the Notice electronically, by calling us at 1-650-690-9100 or  toll free at 1-888-947-8957.<br />

  </strong>We will generally obtain your written authorization before using your  protected health information or disclosing it to outside persons or  organizations. You may revoke any written authorization you have provided to us  at any time, except to the extent that we have made any use(s) or disclosure(s)  of your protected health information in reliance on the authorization. To  revoke an authorization, please send your request in writing with a copy of the  authorization being revoked (or, if not available, a detailed description of  the authorization including the date) to our Privacy Official at the address  above.<br />

  <strong>4.1 For Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations.</strong><br />
    We are allowed to use or disclose your protected health information without  your prior written authorization to provide you with treatment (i.e., to  provide you with health care-related products and services), collect payment  for that treatment, and/or run our normal business operations. Examples of uses  and disclosures for treatment, payment and health care operations are provided  below.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

For  example, we may share your protected health information with public health  officials who are authorized to investigate and control the spread of diseases.  Additional examples of emergency, public health or similar uses or disclosures  of protected health information are provided below.<br />
  <br />

  <br />
  <strong>13.2&nbsp;Friends and Family Involved in Your Care and Emergencies.</strong><br />
    If you need emergency treatment and we are unable to obtain your consent, we  may share your protected health information with a family member, relative, or  close personal friend who is involved in your care or payment for that care. We  may also notify, or assist others in notifying, a family member, friend, or  another person responsible for your care about your location, general condition  or about your death. In some cases, we may need to share your protected health  information with a disaster relief organization that will help us notify these  persons.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>13.3&nbsp;As Required By Law.<br />
  </strong>We may use or disclose your protected health information if we are required  by law&nbsp; to do so. We also will notify you of such uses and disclosures if  we are required by law to do so.<br />
  <strong>13.4&nbsp;Public  Health Activities.<br />
  </strong>We may disclose your  protected health information to authorized public health officials (or a  foreign government agency collaborating with such officials) so they may carry  out their public health activities.

    <li>If we suspect that your death resulted from  criminal conduct.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>13.9&nbsp;To Avert a  Serious Threat to Health or Safety.<br />
    </strong>We may use or disclose  your protected health information with others when necessary to prevent a  serious threat to your health or safety, or to the health or safety of another  person or to the public. In such cases, we will only disclose your protected  health information with someone able to help prevent the threat, including the  target of the threat. We may also disclose your protected health information to  law enforcement officers if you tell us that you participated in a violent  crime that may have caused serious physical harm to another person, or if we  determine that you escaped from lawful custody.<br />

    <strong><br />
      13.15&nbsp;Research.<br />
    </strong>In most cases, we will ask for your written authorization before using or  disclosing your protected health information with others in order to conduct  research. However, under some circumstances, we may use and disclose your  protected health information without your prior authorization if we obtain  approval through a special review process to ensure that research without your  authorization poses minimal risk to your privacy. Under no circumstances,  however, would we allow researchers to use your name or identity publicly. We  may also use or disclose protected health information for research purposes if  we remove certain information that may directly identify you such as your name,  telephone number, Social Security number, medical record number and account  number. We may also release your protected health information without your  prior written authorization to people who are preparing a future research  project, so long as any information identifying you does not leave our  premises. If you die, we may share your protected health information with  people who are conducting research using the information of deceased persons,  so long as they agree not to remove from our offices any information that  identifies you.<br />
    <br />

    <strong>13.18&nbsp;Marketing.</strong><br />
    We may use or disclose your protected health information (including disclosures  to other companies) to make marketing communications to you, or to others,  about the health-related products and services that we provide, and about  alternative treatments, therapies, health care providers, or settings of care  that may be of interest to you.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>14.&nbsp;HOW YOU CAN ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION<br />
  </strong>The following describes the actions you may take with respect to the  protected health information that we maintain.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <strong>14.1&nbsp;Inspect and Copy Records.<br />
</strong>You may request to inspect and obtain a copy of any of your protected  health information that may be used to make decisions about you and your  treatment for as long as we maintain this information in our records. This  includes medical and billing records. Under federal law, however, you may not  inspect or copy the following: (1) information compiled in reasonable anticipation  or, or use in, legal proceedings; or (2) protected health information that is  subject to a law that prohibits access to protected health information.</p>
  <p>To inspect or obtain a  copy of your protected health information, please complete and submit our Request  for Access to Protected Health Information form to the Patient Services  Department. For a copy of the Request for Access to Protected Health  Information form, please call us at<strong><u> 1-650-690-9100 or toll free at 1-888-947-8957.</u></strong> If you request a copy of  your protected health information, we may charge a fee for the costs of  copying, mailing, or other supplies we use to fulfill your request.<br />
    We ordinarily will  respond to your request within 30 days if the protected health information is  located at our Northridge headquarters and within 60 days if it is located at  another facility. If we need additional time to respond, we will notify you in  writing within the foregoing time frame to explain the reason for the delay and  when you can expect to have a final answer to your request. <br />
    Under certain  circumstances, we may deny your request to inspect or obtain a copy of your  protected health information. If we deny part or your entire request, we will  provide a written denial that explains our reasons for doing so, and a complete  description of how you can have that decision reviewed and how to file a  complaint about these issues with us or with the Secretary of the Department of  Health and Human Services. If we deny only part of your request, we will  provide complete access to the remaining parts.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>14.2 Amend Records.<br />
  </strong>If you believe that the protected health information we have about you is  incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to amend the protected health  information. You can request an amendment so long as the protected health  information is kept in our records. To request an amendment, please submit a  written request to our Privacy Official at the address above. Your request must  include your reason for the request.<br />
    Ordinarily we will  respond to your request within 60 days. If we need additional time to respond,  we will notify you in writing within such 60-day period to explain the reason  for the delay and when you can expect a response to your request.<br />
  <br />
    If we deny part or your entire amendment request, we will send you a written  notice that explains our reasons for doing so. If you disagree with our  decision, you may submit a statement explaining the basis for your  disagreement, which we will include in your records. We may prepare and provide  you with a copy of a rebuttal to your statement of disagreement. We will also  provide information on how to file a complaint with us or with the Secretary of  the Department of Health and Human Services. These procedures will be explained  in more detail in any written denial notice we send you.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>14.3 An Accounting of Disclosures.<br />
</strong>You can request an &quot;accounting of disclosures&quot; which provides  information about how we have shared your protected health information with  other persons or organizations. However, you may only receive an accounting of  disclosures made after April 13, 2003 and made within the six (6) years prior  to the date of your request. In addition, an accounting will not include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Disclosures we made to you;</li>
    <li>Disclosures you authorized;</li>
    <li>Disclosures we made in order to provide you  with treatment, obtain payment for that treatment, or conduct our normal  business operations;</li>
    <li>Disclosures made to your friends and family  involved in your care;</li>
    <li>Disclosures made to federal officials for  national security and intelligence activities;</li>
    <li>Disclosures about inmates or detainees to  correctional institutions or law enforcement officers; or</li>
    <li>To request an accounting, please write to our  Privacy Official at the address above. Your request must state a time period  for the disclosures you want us to include.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may receive one  accounting in any 12-month period without charge, but we may charge you for the  cost of providing any additional accounting within the same 12-month period. We  will always notify you of any cost involved so that you may choose to withdraw  or modify your request before any costs are incurred.<br />
    <br />
    Ordinarily we will respond to your request for an accounting within 60 days. If  we need additional time to prepare the accounting, we will notify you in  writing within the 60-day period to explain the reason for the delay and when  you can expect to receive the accounting. In rare cases, we may need to delay  providing you with the accounting without notifying you at the request of a law  enforcement official or government agency.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>15. MORE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS.<br />
  </strong>You may request that we communicate with you about your protected health  information in an alternate manner or means. For example, you may ask that we  contact you at home instead of work. To request an alternate means of  communication or an alternate manner of communication, please write to our  Privacy Official at the address above. We will not ask you the reason for your  request, and we will try to accommodate all reasonable requests. Please specify  in your request how or where you wish to be contacted, and how payment for your  health care will be handled if we communicate with you in this alternate manner  or means.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>16. STRICTER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS.<br />
</strong>You may request that we adopt stricter privacy protections than the privacy  protections set forth in this Notice with respect to uses or disclosures of  your protected health information for (1) Treatment, Payment and Health Care  Operations, and/or (2) to your Family and Friends, as described above. Please  submit your request in writing to our Privacy Official at the address above  specifying the PHI and the restriction(s) being requested. Please note that we  are not required to agree to any requests for stricter privacy protections.  However, if we do agree to a stricter privacy protection, we will send you a  letter detailing such agreement and our rights to terminate such agreement.</p>
